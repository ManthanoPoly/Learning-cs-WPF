# Learning C# with Windows Presentation Forms
I'm totally new to **c#** or **yaml**. I've got a bit of experience with **VBA** in Access and Excel and starting **vb.NET** as well. Since the user base for c# is much broader I'd like to take a look into it. Goals are to be able to create **WPF** programs that look modern, professional and have intuitive UI. My backend should connect to a database like **MySQL/MariaDB** and **SQLite3**. But also alternative saving option would be good to know. 

Feel free to clone this repo in order to learn from it or improve it. Ideally I'd like to have features of whatever this program will turn into to be available in different ways of coding so that other c#/yaml learners can learn by comparing methods they know with what they don't know.
