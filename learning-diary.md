* ok, I'm done now. [continue here](https://youtu.be/sAAKu_SsaoA?list=PLiNd7TUPozDET_shXjcaYQiXscVDGIZkU&t=43) but first I have to manually create this WPF form which he skipped... This is going to be a good practise.

2017.07.27 early: Had to do some drastic changes to the project. SQLite3 is gone. Apparently it doesn't yet support VS2017. Will look for tutorials for MySQL. 

2017.07.27 late: was a real nightmare to get EF 6 working... didn't succeed in it in the end and will have to write database access all manually with my own class system. This is terrible but caused by MySQL for Visual Studio not really working. Started a console app now just to learn more C# syntax from here [C# Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lisiwUZJXqQ)

2017.07.29 Had another one of the win32kfull.sys BSODs as Program.cs started having a lot of code. So I created a new class called OldCode.cs and that's where I keep pasting older code now. Somehow all the syntax highlighting causes a kernel error when it get's too much. Not great though for a program like VS2017 (but also had it in VS2015). Platform Win10 1703 (10.0.15063)

22:30 finished the console tutorial... leant a bunch of new stuff, didn't get it all without proper application but code copied from video will serve as a reference.
